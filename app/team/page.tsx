    bio: "Hi! I'm Joseph, Co-Founder and Lead Consultant of JU STEM Academy. I graduated Magna cum Laude from Cornell University with a degree in Biology and Society, and I've spent the past 4+ years discovering my passion for education. What I love most about this work is simple: every tutoring session is a chance to transform how a student sees learning and help them believe in their own abilities. Outside the classroom, I'm a die-hard Arsenal fan. I recently made the trip to the UK to watch them play live, and it was absolutely electric! I believe the beautiful game and STEM have a lot in common: both require strategy, creativity, and persistence.",

    bio: "Hi! I'm Ukana Bassey, Co-Founder and Lead Academic Tutor of JU STEM Academy. I graduated from Cornell University studying Biology and Society, and I've dedicated the past 4+ years to making STEM education engaging and accessible. My favorite part of this work is creating those breakthrough moments, when a student goes from frustrated to fascinated, when they realize they're capable of so much more than they thought. Outside of academics I enjoy fashion, photography, and endurance training as valuable pastimes!",
